# PCBS: Role of learning in three dimensional form perception
---

For this PCBS project, I will implement in Python the experiments used in the article [Role of learning in three dimensional form perception](https://www.nature.com/articles/384460a0). The project contains different steps:
+ Display a 3D figure with different angles
+ Randomly generate a 3D figure by bending a randomly bending a wire in a 3D space
